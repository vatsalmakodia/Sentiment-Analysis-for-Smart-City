# Sentiment-Analysis-for-Smart-City
Developed a Sentiment Analysis Model based on Natural Language Processing that analyses the tweets or comments related to Vadodara City and returns the sentiment of the commentator.
Shows the summary of the analysis in the form of a count as well as a bar graph.
Useful in knowing the sentiment and feedback of the public towards the development of the city as well as the City Management.
The model also generates an output CSV stating the sentiment of each comment. Works in bulk as well as on a single line.

To run the model change the source of the csv file and run all blocks to understand the process. Also change the column names of the excel files if needed.
